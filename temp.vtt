talk about its awning that's what i'm
saying
 
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.870
and it provides smooth transitions
between
 
00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:14.950
the only reason people don't use it is
because
 
00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:20.230
sorry i have to dance on you i'm i'm
sorry

one second because i'm because i also
wear
 
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:07.509
because i'm a game character but if i
was
 
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.110
unreal it's on real right no no this is
oh
 
00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:33.029
if that's part of the calibration
process
 
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.349
um like work and i'll have to have a
portfolio
 
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.589
trying to make stuff reusable and nicely
compartmentalized
 
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.270
the set i'll write my get messages to
myself
 
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.310
fix bug changes it's like it's stupid i
i
 
00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:49.109
when when why she can't find anything
yeah
 
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:07.990
piss that's one of mine i guess i write
piss
 
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.510
but but honestly the comments are pretty
uh
 
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:35.990
when i was a nerd programmer i read i
read
 
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.030
if i'm not planning on making it a full
thing
 
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.950
i'll scuff the [ __ ] out of it in like in
python
 
00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:34.069
back in the back when i was started and
man-made
 
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.270
every day was an experimentation so she
never
 
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.550
she just just got it yep yeah i like
that
 
00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:05.829
that stuff to help freaking roomba it
happens
 
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:12.710
yeah that one's so bad yeah i mean it
doesn't
 
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.390
i does this do you use it to clean your
room
 
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.190
he's got the early onset schizophrenia
too
 
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:58.870
yeah poor guy it's okay he's scuffed to
hell
 
00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:14.790
it's um the vision stuff i wrote which
isn't
 
 
00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:34.630
too so it's so very extremely bomb like
um
 
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.349
parent company tried to take all his
money
 
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:55.589
like man that looks kind of [ __ ]
awesome
 
00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.190
never happens do you know who the baby
is
 
00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:45.750
really yeah yeah completely off top that
was
 
00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:56.150
kill it kill that [ __ ] put it down sorry
buddy
 
00:43:58.319 --> 00:43:59.990
we gotta put you down risen from the
ashes
 
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.790
that firework only lasts like two
 
 
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.870
i bet yeah would you ever be a virtual
character
 
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:27.510
someone's body yes can you make me a
tony
 
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.030
me knowing that there was a bunch of
setup
 
00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:21.829
bad at setup and stuff so i get fatigued
lazy
 
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:49.910
was like playing minecraft and some dumb
stuff
 
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.589
yeah when i didn't go back to streaming
soon-ish
 
00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:25.270
i feel like i've been stunted in stuff i
know
 
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.230
um hmm i'm trying to come up with some
ideas
 
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.230
as it was pissed into a toilet to
predict
 
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.349
how would you ever make that a video
ever
 
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.390
i have some listed down you ready okay
 
 
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.309
you're excited okay wait let me give you
more
 
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:33.750
what the taste is you when your heart
beats
 
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.349
that's true kind of it's just a face
maker
 
00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.589
what about maybe something with
heartbeat
 
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.549
something like this like a giant kuka
robot
 
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.829
that exists for sure not that i would
know
 
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.430
what can you find out if the size of
feet
 
00:55:04.559 --> 00:55:05.190
and penises yeah most people can't do
either
 
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.309
i built like a cup that you piss into
for
 
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.030
a cup that fills with urine as i pee
into
 
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:55.750
um but i hooked it up to a [ __ ]
database
 
00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:23.589
when i would pee next based on previous
pisses
 
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:35.990
not that i know but i've heard from
people
 
00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.549
learning is actually really easy to
learn
 
00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:00.309
getting anywhere with that goddamn
tutorial
 
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.630
super good at electronics it's also
boring
 
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.430
yeah i wanted to charge i wanted to
charge
 
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.510
a little clotty with the jungle juice
yeah
 
00:58:32.079 --> 00:58:32.549
oh my gosh and baja blast for good
measure
 
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.470
i try to get hit with the diet monster
and
 
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.390
mountain of sugar how are you are you
constantly
 
00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.549
i'm so excited about your robot ideas i
just
 
00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:57.430
yeah i could i could see it i want um i
think
 
01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:01.109
learning that uh like you use unreal
right
 
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.150
and i had it on a stream that was just
me
 
01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.750
a real-life sim simulation but in real
life
 
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.030
okay so she'll have like mood meters
right
 
01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.670
been sleeping and like how much you've
pissed
 
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:57.589
robotics oh i can help with robotics
stuff
 
01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.029
i can do that that i can do i i've kind
of
 
01:02:32.839 --> 01:02:42.150
as long as it's not a real
 
 
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:26.549
together and make something
 
 
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:29.990
you could do like chat i think you could
do
 
01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:23.430
walking away is the controlled
environment
 
 
01:05:15.039 --> 01:05:16.150
the beginning guys i actually had no
idea
 
01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:04.150
um the the bits not working in the
beginning
 
 
01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.590
epic idea but you know what keeps on
going
 
01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.669
dancing then i can't actually stop
dancing
 
01:10:12.719 --> 01:10:14.149
that's a good thing you're not wearing
it
 
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:55.189
absolutely suck my neck would probably
 
 
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.870
then now it's moving back to the
beginning
 
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.510
it's going [ __ ] yeah how's it going with
you
 
01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.430
someday maybe i'll make it drill
something
 
01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.790
drilling uh
 
 
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.229
uh what can you drill the wall okay i
need
 
01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:50.950
like little housing for it that's very
quirky
 
01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.070
if you get like the little risers from
amazon
 
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.790
that is actually quite nice you know you
know
 
01:15:18.719 --> 01:15:19.189
it happens it happens she does that's
okay
 
01:15:25.199 --> 01:15:26.870
gamer yeah yeah games plus virtual
production
 
01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:42.470
at work but it was just a long time ago
that's
 
01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.149
that's familiar that's a fun one i if
you
 
01:15:59.199 --> 01:16:00.070
great bridge between software and
hardware
 
01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.149
because it's like you write code onto a
microcontroller
 
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:39.750
it happens to me i mean not me but
technician
 
01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.430
why did technician put these dogs in why
why
 
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.149
pretty basic c code for it and it it can
like
 
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.350
is attached to the piss cup that sends
um
 
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.229
that's like a fun little project you can
do
 
01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.229
i want to get into this stuff i don't
know
 
01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.350
health i don't have a computer science
degree
 
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.310
oh i got ups did you get on your pants
too
 
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.750
no no no it messed it down it was like
running
 
01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.390
so that's good that means it's still
working
 
01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:37.750
doesn't cut out it didn't do anything
bad
 
01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.189
